# movie-recommendation-system

Recommendation systems are an important part of suggesting items in streaming services. For streaming movie services like Netflix,
recommendation systems are essential for helping users find new movies
to enjoy. We propose a deep learning approach based on Deep
autoencoders and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to produce
a collaborative filtering system which predicts movie ratings for a user
based on a large database of ratings from other users. We use concept of
deep learning to predict users’ ratings on new movies. The model uses
model based Collaborative Filtering ,Single Value
Decomposition(SVD) a matrix factorisation technique, which reduces
the number of features of a dataset by reducing the space dimension
from N-dimension to K-dimension (where K<N). Input is Movies and
Ratings table which contains rating of users on various movies and the
output will be the Top Recommended movies for the user predicted by
the System.
